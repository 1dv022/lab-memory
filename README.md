# Lab Memory

The laboration will be devided into three (?) levels where the first level is a classic minimalistic way of writing a task of this kind for the browser and the last level is fully compared for testability. 

## Level 1 - Clean


## Level 2 - Using Commonjs


## Level 3 - Prepared for tests
